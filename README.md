# cs182-elevator-project
AI learning to speed up elevator queue times using Reinforcement Learning and Monte Carlo simulation. For Harvard CS 182 final project.

The main files are located in `/elevator`, and external related files are in the root of the repo.

Suggested parameters are listed here. Full parameters are described in final project report:

- RL: `python elevator.py -a rl -t200 -n100 -q`
- naive: `python elevator.py -n500 -q`
- MC: `python elevator.py -a monte -n50`
